 Pressing the KIM-1's 1..5 Keys simulates rolling a 4 6 8 10 
 20 or 100 sided dice. The result is displayed as a random   
 number in the range 1-4, 1-6, 1-8, 1-10, 1-20 and 1-100,    
 respectively.                                               
 Holding one of the above keys down will display successive  
 random numbers but too fast to read. pressing any other key 
 will clear the display to zeros. "Random" numbers are       
 derived from the free-running build-in timer in the KIM-1.
